            "On June 28, 1969 police raided the Stonewall Inn, one of the few establishments that at the time welcomed people from the gay community. Brave individuals rose up to demand LGBTQ equality and the so called Stonewall Riots that followed and lasted for 5 nights, became the beginning of the modern LGBTQ rights movement. To honor the Stonewall Riot’s 50th anniversary and share the many stories that have gone untold, Stink Studios partnered with the <a href=\"https://gaycenter.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LGBT Community Center</a>, with support from <a href=\"https://www.google.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google.org</a>, to create Stonewall Forever.",

Through the online form people, that have been a part of this historic period, are encouraged to add any historical material or personal stories to a growing collection which will be available online and at the LGBT Community Center’s National History Archive in New York.",

The brief was to raise awareness of the problems of maternal and newborn death in low income countries, by mainly focusing on emphasizing the benefits of midwifery, and the important role midwives have when it comes to ensure a safe pregnancy and motherhood for all women. The long term goal is for maternal and newborn health to be a prioritized topic in every country and government.",

To reach out to as many social media users as possible we used Thunderclap, which is a powerful crowd speaking tool. In addition to this we built a dropdown Twitter recruit where a specific country is targeted and a list of influential Twitter users popular in that country can be shuffled and encouraged to join the cause through Thunderclap. The campaign successfully reached a big crowd and #midwives4all reached trending topic on Twitter by the end of the campaign.",
